        <item>PLAN THE LIGHTING. \n\n It is important to not spend more than desired on electricity. Also, if you paint the walls and ceiling a light color, you gain brightness and therefore use less electricity.</item>
        <item>CHANGE THE LIGHT BULBS  \n\n Replacing all the light bulbs with low-consumption ones saves, for each of them, about 8€ a year. If you have 30 at home, that\'s about 240€ annually. A good amount, right? LEDs are even more efficient and are increasingly used in home decoration. Although their price is slightly higher, they not only consume less, but they also offer more durability (25,000 hours compared to the 5,000 of low-consumption ones), they reach their maximum brightness instantly, and they don\'t deteriorate from successive turn-ons and turn-offs.</item>
        <item>CALCULATE YOUR CONSUMPTION A \n\n consumption meter helps to instantly know in euros what you consume. They are not very expensive (starting from 60€) and can lower the electricity bill by 45% (if heating is gas, then up to 20%). Some allow scheduling the power off.</item>
        <item> CHECK THE FACILITIES.\n\n It is necessary for both safety reasons and to avoid excessive spending. In new houses, the review should be done every 10 years, while those over 25 years old should be studied every 5 years. Before doing so, request budgets.</item>
        <item>TURN OFF THE LIGHTS.\n\n It is necessary for both safety reasons and to avoid excessive spending. Don\'t forget, small gestures are what save.</item>
        <item>CLEAN THE LIGHT BULBS AND SCREENS.\n\n Keep the light bulbs clean, as dirt absorbs light and consumes more electricity to achieve a certain intensity. Do it often, always with the bulb turned off. Repeat the same operation with the screens of the lamps.</item>
        <item>BEWARE OF VAMPIRES.\n\n Leaving appliances or computer with the pilot light on increases the electric bill between 5% and 16%. Instead of turning them off with the remote and leaving them on standby, plug them into a strip with a switch. This way, you can fully deactivate them just by turning it off.</item>
        <item>WHAT IS THE COMFORT TEMPERATURE?\n\n It is estimated that 20ºC is the optimal temperature for the entire house. For each degree higher, consumption increases between 5% and 10%. At night and when you are not home, set it to 15ºC. Proper temperature regulation can save you over 100€ per year.</item>
        <item>INSTALL A THERMOSTAT.\n\n It is simple and inexpensive (starting at 30€). Programmable thermostats allow you to adjust the temperature to your habits and set the time when the radiators turn on. Check their instructions to get the most out of them.</item>
        <item>CHECK THE BOILER.\n\n A dusty or greasy boiler consumes more. Don\'t wait for it to break down to check it, as with regular maintenance you will not only extend its life, but also reduce the bill by 10%. It is ideal to check it once a year at the start of the season.</item>
        <item>MAKE USE OF BLINDS.\n\n Raise them during the day so that sunlight can enter and warm the house naturally and lower them at night to protect the house from the cold. You can do the same with curtains (the thicker the better). Reinforce the insulation of windows with window seals.</item>

        <item>ADAPT YOUR CLOTHING TO THE TIME OF YEAR.\n\n If it\'s winter, why are you walking around the house in short sleeves? Don\'t dress in December like in August and you will avoid "wasting" heating when it's not so cold or having it at an excessively high temperature. Close doors to quickly heat the room you want.</item>
        <item>CONCENTRATE HEAT.\n\n If there are rooms you hardly use, you don\'t need to spend on heating them. Close the doors so that the heat is concentrated in the part of the house you use, and even close the valve of its plates. With this gesture you can save between 5% and 8% of energy.</item>
        <item>INSULATE WITH RUGS.\n\n Rugs also help to provide warmth to "cold" floors such as marble or porcelain.</item>
        <item>DO NOT COVER THE RADIATORS.\n\n Their ideal location is under windows because the air that filters helps distribute heat. That being said, avoid covering them with curtains or other objects as then they "work" harder to heat the same. Radiator covers are not recommended.</item>
        <item>TURN OFF THE COMPUTER.\n\n If you are not going to use it for half an hour, it\'s best to turn it off because the hard drive won\'t wear out. When it comes to short intervals, turn off the screen, which is what consumes the most. Keep in mind that when energy-saving mode is activated, consumption is reduced to 15%.</item>
        <item>TURN ON CEILING FANS ALL YEAR ROUND.\n\n Ceiling fans are also very useful in winter. As hot air tends to rise, by putting it in "winter" mode, the blades reverse their usual direction and move the accumulated air towards the floor.</item>
        <item>USE SOLAR CHARGERS. \n\n For your mobile phone or laptop, a solar charger recharges batteries with zero energy cost. Conventional chargers consume between 0.03 W (the most efficient) and 0.5 W, and their main problem is that if they are plugged in without appliances, they continue to consume.</item>
        <item>DO NOT WASTE WATER.\n\n The toilet is not a trash can. Do not throw papers there and then empty the tank. To avoid this, keep a small bucket in the bathroom. It is estimated that 30% of water consumption comes from the toilet and that each person flushes it a thousand times a year.</item>
        <item>USE DUAL FLUSH SYSTEM.\n\n Double flush or interruption systems are the most suitable for reducing water consumption. If you have an old cistern, you can easily adapt them without having to change the entire system. They are available in hardware stores or plumbing stores.</item>
        <item>BE CAREFUL WITH LEAKS.\n\n It is estimated that a dripping faucet wastes about 35,000 liters of water per year. When you detect that it is losing water, turn off the water supply when not in use. You can do the same if your toilet is leaking. To detect the leak, put a few drops of food coloring in the cistern.</item>

        <item>CLOSE THE TAPS.\n\n While you soap up in the shower or brush your teeth, don\'t let the water run. 10 liters of water are wasted in a minute. Similarly, open the tap to a minimum. If you wash your hands, you don't need the 20-liter flow per minute, 6 liters per minute are enough.</item>
        <item>BATHING IS BETTER.\n\n Showering instead of bathing can save up to 70 liters of water each time. If possible, install thermostatic taps and you will also save.</item>
        <item>TEMPERATURE AT THE MOMENT.\n\n A dual control faucet takes almost a minute to reach the desired temperature, while a thermostatic one takes two seconds. This saves about 80,000 liters of water per year. It is possible to replace the ceramic cartridge with a thermostatic kit and not have to change the faucet.</item>
        <item>INSTALL AERATORS.\n\n Installing an aerator on the faucet is very easy, as they are purchased at the hardware store and screwed onto the faucet pipe. This device mixes air with water without affecting water pressure and reduces consumption by 50%. There are also showerheads with this system.</item>
        <item>FLOW RESTRICTORS.\n\n Flow restrictors are easily installed at the faucet outlet and prevent it from opening beyond a predetermined angle. They can also be installed in the shower. This way, the water consumption of the faucets goes from 15 to 8 liters per minute and that of the shower from 20 to 10 liters.</item>
        <item>WATERING WISELY.\n\n Whether on the terrace or in the garden, bet on native plants (as they are adapted to the climate they need less water) and group them according to their water needs. Do not water them during sunny hours and, if possible, use rainwater to water the plants.</item>
        <item>WASHING, COLD!.\n\n Washing in cold saves, as almost 90% of the energy consumed by a washing machine is used to heat the water.</item>
